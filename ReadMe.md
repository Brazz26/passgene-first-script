## Password generator website

This project was inspire by commonplace times of trying to figure out a particularly
difficult password in order to protect an individual's account.
I built this project to gain a foundation for password generation websites.
This websites free an individual of the burden of creating a password.
I've learned different methods to use javascript and incorporate into a html webpage such as functions, objects and arrays.
